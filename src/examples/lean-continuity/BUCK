# Continuity: The Straylight Build Formalization
#
# A formal proof that the Continuity build system maintains correctness
# across content-addressed derivations, typed toolchains, and isolation
# boundaries.
#
# This example requires Mathlib, so we use Lake (Lean's package manager)
# rather than the raw lean_binary rule.
#
# Build: buck2 build //src/examples/lean-continuity:continuity
# Check: buck2 build //src/examples/lean-continuity:continuity
