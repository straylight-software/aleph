message: "ALEPH-E001: `with lib;` statement"
note: |
  ## What's wrong?
  Usage of the `with lib;` construct was detected.

  This is forbidden because it:
  - Obscures where names come from
  - Breaks tooling (no go-to-definition, no accurate autocomplete)
  - Creates shadowing hazards when lib adds new attributes
  - Makes code review require mental scope tracking

  ## What can I do to fix this?
  Try something like this instead:

  ```nix
  inherit (lib) types mkOption;
  ```
